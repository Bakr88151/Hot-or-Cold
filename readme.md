# Hot and cold:

a very simple game Where in you decide the defficult (an int), the program then selects a random number from the range (0 to dificulty) and you have to guess the number in less than five attempts, to help you, the program will print Hot! if your current guess is closer to the target than the previous one, and Cold! if your guess is further.
